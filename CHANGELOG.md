# Changes

## Release 0.10.1 - March 16, 2020

* Removed deprecated Error descriptions
* Swapped smallvec for tinyvec. Thanks to [@Shnatsel](https://github.com/Shnatsel) for the contribution!

## Release 0.10.0 - January 30, 2020

* MSRV increased to 1.36.0. This is mainly because smallvec needs 1.36.0 now.
* Updated to smallvec 1.0. Thanks to [@repi](https://github.com/repi) for the contribution!
* C API via cbingen/cargo-c. Thanks to [@lu-zero](https://github.com/lu-zero) for the contribution!
* Various simplifications in audio.rs. Thanks to [@AnthonyMikh](https://github.com/AnthonyMikh) for the contribution!
* Moved from Travis CI to Github Actions. Thanks to [@Luni-4](https://github.com/Luni-4) for the contribution!
* Adopted a workspace to have a common Cargo.lock file.

## Release 0.9.4 - March 08, 2019

* Added a function to obtain the stream serial from an `OggStreamReader`
* Invalid UTF-8 strings in comment headers are now silently omitted
* Allowed to specify floats as output format
* Fixed multiple bugs on fuzzed inputs

## Release 0.9.3 - October 28, 2018

* Fixed wrongly decoded files. Now, not a single mismatch to libvorbis is left on the xiph and libnogg test vectors (issue [#26](https://github.com/RustAudio/lewton/issues/26))
* Updated ogg to 0.7.0

## Release 0.9.2 - October 07, 2018

* Fixed a wrongly decoded file bug (issue [#24](https://github.com/RustAudio/lewton/issues/24))

## Release 0.9.1 - September 22, 2018

* Performance improvements of about 10%. Thanks to [@GabrielMajeri](https://github.com/GabrielMajeri) for the contribution!
* Fixed some wrongly decoded files
* Fixed some panics on crafted input. Thanks to [@Shnatsel](https://github.com/Shnatsel) for the fuzzing and bug reports.
* Added travis CI

## Release 0.9.0 - August 16, 2018

* Renamed `async` to `async_api` for better edition 2018 compilance
* Updated ogg to 0.6.0
* Expanded test suite to include xiph test vectors
* Support for chained files

## Release 0.8.0 - February 7, 2018

* Removed unused error enum variant
* Pub used OggReadError so that people can match on its variants without needing to depend on the Ogg crate
* Used min instead of residue_begin/residue_end directly. See also [the PR](https://github.com/xiph/vorbis/pull/35) that modified the vorbis spec accordingly.

## Release 0.7.0 - October 24, 2017

* Removed all uses of unsafe in return of making Rust 1.20 required

## Release 0.6.2 - June 18, 2017

* Exposed blockize_0 and blocksize_1 in the public API
  of the ident header again, so that lewton can be used without ogg encapsulation.

## Release 0.6.1 - June 8, 2017

* Fix a doc link

## Release 0.6.0 - June 8, 2017

* Made parts of the API that are not intended for the public crate local
* Added seeking support with a granularity of pages
* Updated to ogg to 0.5.0
* The async support now doesn't need unstable features any more, and bases on tokio

## Release 0.5.2 - May 13, 2017

* Removed two unused macros to prevent warnings about them

## Release 0.5.1 - April 30, 2017

* Bugfix to work on newest Rust nightly/beta
* Bugfix to work with the alto crate instead of openal-rs which has been yanked
* Bugfix in the player example for duration calculation

## Release 0.5 - February 15, 2017

* New, more convenient, constructor for OggStreamReader.
* Updated to Byteorder 1.0.

## Release 0.4.1 - November 17, 2016

* Fixed a panic issue with reading huffman trees.

## Release 0.4 - October 4, 2016

* Updated ogg.
* Made the `inside_ogg` API own the reader.

## Release 0.3 - October 4, 2016

* Added support for floor 0. It is not used in practice anymore,
  but now all features of the vorbis format are supported.
* Improved the API for reading decoded packets.
* Fixed a bug in comment header parsing.
* Various minor simplifications.
* Improved the cmp tool. You can now compare our output to libvorbis
  with `cargo test --release -- --nocapture`,
  and our speed with `cargo run --release bench`.

## Release 0.2 - September 13, 2016

* Improved speed by about 20%.
* Added async ready API to the `inside_ogg` module to work with async IO.
  Still behind a feature as it relies on the unstable [specialisation feature](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844).
* Removed parts of the API that were irrelevant to users of the crate.
  This gives a better overview for our users.
  Unfortunately due to [pub(crate) not being stable yet](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32409),
  not all parts of the API could have been made private.
* Examples are CC-0 now, this should ease adoption.
* Documentation improvements
* Implemented a tool to compare our speed and output with libvorbis.
  To see how correct this crate is, cd to `dev/cmp` and do `cargo run --release vals /path/to/test_file.ogg`.
  For speed tests, swap "vals" with "perf".

## Release 0.1 - September 1, 2016

Initial release.
